Factory params to actual params:
params[0] = a
params[1] = b
params[2] = c
params[3] = d

NOTE #1:
    there mey be problem on border functions
    while not defining functions bounds we can easily allow all to add their own functions
    however there mey be problem when record has x smaller than "printer bonds" <-- se printer functions

    Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY and Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY on near bonds

NOTE #2:
    considering we will be using databases we can set bounds by using the database low and max values
    and ues them while appending Membership functions

NOTE #3:
    Truth checker can be a singleton, there is no need to create it for every summary
